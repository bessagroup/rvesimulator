We have made changes to the element formulation and modified the min, max time step size to 1e-2 and 1e-8 respectively.
We have made changes to the microstructure generator so that the geometric structure is now more sensible (avoids weird meshes), esp at the boundaries.
Plus more spaced and uniform sized particles. The seed problems are fixed as well

Intial increment possible to 1e-2  for the time stepping.
The pseudo time step is set to 20 points

We have made changes to the matrix parameter such that the poisson ratio is reduced from 0.48 to 0.45
The particles are 100 times stiffer (Young's modulus) than the matrix
