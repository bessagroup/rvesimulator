### **Summary**

The **rvesimulator** aims to provide a user-friendly, automated Python-based framework conducting Representative Volume Element (RVE) simulation via powerful Finite Element Method (FEM) software Abaqus. By utilizing this repository, large amount of reliable FEM data-set generation is possible with RVEs encompassing materials from elastic to plastic composites .

**rvesimulator** provides:

1.  A cross-platform function to run arbitrary Python-Abaqus script without graphical user interface (GUI), it offers users a convenience way to run their unique scripts
2.  Python-Abaqus scripts to simulate RVE with different design of experiments including various micro-structures, material laws, and loading;
3.  Benchmarks of running prevalent RVEs covering elastic, hyper-elastic, plastic materials are provided, which illustrates the general pipeline (preprocess, execution, and postprocess) of the developed framework

This idea of the repo is shown by the following figures:

### **State of need**

[rvesimulator](https://github.com/bessagroup/rvesimulator) is an open-source Python-based framework for RVE simulation via [ABAQUS](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/) secondary development. It is noted that ABAQUS 2021 is used in the development. In order to conduct RVE simulation via [rvesimulator](https://github.com/bessagroup/rvesimulator) , basic knowledge of [ABAQUS](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/) usage, especially Python scripting, is required. Meanwhile, basic understanding of RVE simulation is also required. Several examples are provided in the [Tutorials](https://github.com/bessagroup/rvesimulator/tree/main/tutorials) where users can learn the basic usage of [rvesimulator](https://github.com/bessagroup/rvesimulator). If the user wants to develop their own RVE simulation, the [Documentation](https://bessagroup.github.io/rvesimulator/) provides a detailed description on how to adapt the framework to their own needs.
