Summary
-------

This repo aims to do representative volume element (RVE) simulation via `ABAQUS <https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/>`__.
It has two main parts:

- Part 1
    - Generate microstructure of RVE;
    - Configure material properties of RVE;
    - Configure loading conditions of RVE;
    - Encode all the information into a **Json** file as the input of ABAQUS;
    - Take the **Pickle** file generated by ABAQUS and perform further post-processing.
    
- Part 2
    - Read the Json file;
    - Run ABAQUS simulation;
    - Extract results from ABAQUS output file;
    - Encode results into a **Pickle** file.

The workflow of this repo is shown in the following figure.
