1. problem description
----------------------
RVE simulation is an effective approach to explore constitutive laws of composites. 
Generally, An RVE has two material Phases which are matrix phase and fiber phase. 
The following figure gives an illustration of micro-structure of a 2D RVE.

**microstructures**, **material properties**, and **loading conditions** are three 
major variables which will influence the RVE properties. In order to exploit the advantages and limits of CDDM, 
several RVEs with similarities and differences are set up as different tasks. 
In detail, different tasks have different microstructures and material properties and apply the same dependent 
paths to generate the learning dataset


2. tasks set up
---------------
From the above figure, it can be seen that the microstructure of an RVE is controlled by four factors 
which are size of the square, volume fraction of fiber phase, and distribution parameters for generating 
fibers. Meanwhile, the material properties of fiber and matrix phases also influence the performance of 
RVEs significantly.


Therefore, several designated microstructures and material properties are given as the design variables 
for generating different tasks. The details of for different tasks are summarized in the following table.

3. implementation
-----------------

The implementation of task A is based on the following steps:

.. code-block:: python
    
    # import the function
    from rvesimulator.benchmarks.cddm_rve import CDDM_RVE
    from rvesimulator.additions.ampitudesampler import AmplitudeGenerator
    from rvesimulator.additions.hardening_law import LinearHardeningLaw
    # generate amplitude path as the design variable
    # number of path
    num_amplitude = 2
    # initialize path sampler
    path_sampler = AmplitudeGenerator(num_dim=3)
    # get paths
    paths = path_sampler.get_amplitude(
        num_amplitude=num_amplitude,
        num_control=8,
        num_steps=100,
        arg_name="strain_amplitude",
        seed=1,
    )
    # convert to dict
    samples_dict = paths.to_dict("records")
    # initialization for task A
    task_A = CDDM_RVE()
    # update simulation info
    taskA.update_sim_info(mesh_partition=100,
                          strain=[0.02, 0.02, 0.02],
                          vol_req=0.45,
                          radius_mu=0.01,
                          radius_std=0.003,
                          youngs_modulus_fiber=10,
                          youngs_modulus_matrix=100,
                          hardening_law=SwiftHardeningLaw(a=0.5, b=0.5, yield_stress=0.5),
                          num_cpu=8,
                          seed=2,
                          print_info=False)
    task_A_results = {}
    # calculate responses of simulation
    for ii in range(len(samples_dict)):
        task_A_results[ii] = taskA.run_simulation(
            sample=samples_dict[ii], third_folder_index=ii
        )

.. note::
    For other tasks, the only difference is the initialization of the task. you can 
    easily change the task by using corresponding parameters from the above table.
